description="""Get the upstream nucleotide sequence of the given set of genes.
Requires you to have the contigs loaded into the database. It is careful to only
print sequences up to the next called gene or gap (N) in the sequence unless you
tell it not to. This is because upstream regions are often used to search for motifs
but motifs may be hard to distinguish from strong protein sequence conservation in
protein-coding regions.

Explanation of warnings:
CONTIGEND - Upstream region reached the end of a contig.
NOUPSTREAM - There is no upstream region (either another gene overlaps or immediately abuts, or the gene reaches the very end of a contig)
CONTAINSGAP - if there are a large number of n's (user-defined but default is to warn if any N's are present).
OTHERGENE - If there is another gene within N nucleotides upstream of the query gene.

Automatically transposes the DNA and rotates it around so that it should be possible to directly compare motifs...
