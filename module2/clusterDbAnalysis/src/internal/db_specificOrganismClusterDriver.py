# Read the file group file (specified in stdin) 
# and for each group, set up and call a MCL command
# clustering these groups.
#
# First calls the python command to connect to the SQL database and collect
# all of the blast results for the organisms of interest.
# Then, pipe those results to MCL via the mcxdeblast command
#
# Put the results in a file with the names of all the parts of the group
# separated by "_"
#
# Note - this function itself doesn't specifically call the database but depends on two functions that do.
