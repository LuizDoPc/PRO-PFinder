# This is a pipe command.
# 
# Pipe in the cluster file (from MCL)
# and the flattened file comes out in stdout
# You must provide this function what parameters you used to generate
# the clusters:
#
# - inflation
# - distance metric
# - cutoff
#
# All of these will go into the run ID.
#
# The "flattened file" contains only three columns:
# - A run ID (which should be unique)
# - Cluster number 
# - Gene ID
#
# This will make it easy to generate SQL queries for particular clusters
# (e.g. give me the blast results for all of the genes listed in cluster 1
# against anything else)
