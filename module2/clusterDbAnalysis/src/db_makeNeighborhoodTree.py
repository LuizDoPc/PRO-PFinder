NOTE: If you get an error complaining about missing fonts:

reportlab.graphics.renderPM.RenderPMError: Can't setFont(Times-Roman) missing the T1 files?

it means your installation of reportlab is missing the font files for Times New Roman
and you should install them. How to install them:

1: Download the .pfb files from the reportlab website. The current location is:
http://www.reportlab.com/ftp/fonts/pfbfer.zip

2: Extract them to one of the places reportlab looks for the files.
One of those locations is ${HOME}/fonts so follow these directions:

$ cd ~
$ mkdir fonts
$ cd fonts
$ wget http://www.reportlab.com/ftp/fonts/pfbfer.zip
$ unzip pfbfer.zip

When you run this again, it should work.

See the following for more details.
