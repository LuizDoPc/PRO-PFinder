description = """Given a TBLASTN output from db_TBlastN_wrapper,
attempt to automatically identify frameshifts and fragments of the same
gene that appear on separate lines.

The criteria for a frameshift is if the TBLASTN interval is on the same
strand in different frames in two differnet hits and they are within INTERVAL
base pairs of each other.

The criteria for a nonsense mutation is if a single hit has an internal
stop codon.

The criteria for an insertion is if there are two hits within INTERVAL
base pairs of each other.

All of these require manual curation to ensure that alternative causes
such as gene duplications and two distantly-related but close-proximity genes
are not the cause for the observed anomolies.

This function only works if we can access the database and pull out contigs.
It won't work for TBLASTN results from arbitrary fastn files"""
