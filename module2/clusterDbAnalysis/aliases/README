This folder is for files containing PEG IDs in one column and any aliases you want
added to the annotations in the second column.

In the conversion from "raw" to "processed" tables, we go ahead and add them to the annotation.
This makes it easy to search for particular genes.

Format:

PEG ID   |  Alias to add

You can add more than one alias to a particular peg ID. The aliases are all added with underscores (_)
in the order in which they appear in the aliases file.
