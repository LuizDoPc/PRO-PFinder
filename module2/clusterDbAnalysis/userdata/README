Thsi folder is to contain user-inputted data that is imported in the database and optionally
used for certain analyses.

Currently supported files:

* user_genes

Specs are listed below.


## user_genes

A tab-delimited table with the following columns. Leave the column empty if the data is unavailable.

user_geneid TEXT PRIMARY KEY : User-specified gene ID (must be unique and distinct from any of those in the
                               genes in ITEP)
organismid TEXT NOT NULL     : Organism ID (must match an organism ID in ITEP)
genetype TEXT NOT NULL       : Type of gene (something to identify to you where it came from)
contigid TEXT                : Contig ID (NULL or matching a contig in ITEP)
startloc INTEGER             : Beginning of the HSP (this might have different meaning for different type)
stoploc INTEGER              : Stop of the HSP (this might have different meaning for different type)
runid TEXT                   : Run ID for a cluster you believe the gene belongs to
clusterid INTEGER            : Cluster ID for a cluster you believe the gene belongs to
seq TEXT                     : Sequence of the user-defined gene (if available)
annotation TEXT              : Putative function

Any of the fields can be undefined except user_geneid, organismid and genetype

Currently the following uses will be supported:

- Genes without sequences can still be used for presence/absence analysis (optionally)
- User-specified genes can be searched by ID, type or function and some of the existing tools
  (e.g. annoteSeq2Fasta.py) can be used with the resulting table.

More support will likely be added in the future.
