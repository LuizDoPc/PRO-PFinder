### GENBANK Readme file

########
# NOTE #
########

This folder is intended to contain Genbank files. We require genbank
files for every organism because they are needed to automatically generate
intermediates and also for TBLASTN and other whole-genome analyses. They are also
a common exchange format that is readily available from many sources.

The convertGenbank2Table.py function automatically takes care of formatting
and naming requirements for Genbank files (which are listed below for your reference).

**To import a Genbank file into ITEP do the following **

1: Put the genbank file somewhere OTHER THAN THIS FOLDER
2: Run convertGenbank2Table.py (see help for that function for syntax help).

convertGenbank2Table will generate a "raw" file (see raw/README), which is a tab-delimited
file, and a Genbank file. A copy of your Genbank file will be placed here with the correct
name for the programs to work. If you ask convertGenbank2Table.py to add ITEP IDs to your 
genbank file, the Genbank file placed here will have the ITEP IDs in it.

FOR REFERENCE (you don't need to worry about this unless something goes wrong)

#############################
#  FILE NAMING REQUIREMENTS #
#############################

File names must have the format

[organismid].gbk 

The organism ID must match the regex "\d+\.\d+" (or [0-9]+\.[0-9]+).
The first number must be the tax ID specified in the genbank file. 
The second number is arbitrary.

For example:

83333.1.gbk

would be the filename for E. coli.

The organism ID must match an organism ID in at least one raw file.

#############################
# WHAT MUST BE IN THE FILES #
#############################

Fundamentally, the program requires the following fields from the genbank files. 
Everything else is ignored (including any gene IDs, sequences, etc. - they are
imported to the database from the raw file instead).

- /organism="[organism name]" : Used to generate the organisms file
- /dbxref="taxid:[taxid]" : Used to check consistency with the organism ID. The first number in the
  organism ID should be the taxID.
- A LOCUS field containing a contig name (without spaces but length does not matter). The contig 
  name must be consistent with the contig name in the raw file.
- The contig's sequence.

If you have multiple contigs (or multiple chromosomes, or a chromosome and a plasmid, etc.), 
you should concatinate the genbank files for each one into a single file with a name consistent
with the file naming requirements above.
