'''This library contains functions for generating a GML file for a particular
cluster of interest.

It includes helper files for making pretty colors. The intention is for you to import
the resulting GML file into Cytoscape or similar and use their rendering capabilities
to view it.

WARNING - Cytoscape 3 beta's GML reader is broken; it does not read attributes correctly (this has
been fixed and targeted for 3.0.1). If you want to read the attributes in go back to cytoscape
2.8.3

    Cytoscape can handle I might need to change this into something else)
