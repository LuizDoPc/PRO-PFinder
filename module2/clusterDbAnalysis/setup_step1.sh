# - Tab-delimited seed files (in "raw" directrory)
# - organism file (in root directory)
#
# Required to install:
#
# Python
# Ruffus (python package - for parallelizing)
# BLAST+ (including TBLASTN for pseudogene finding, and BLASTP for initial clustering...)
# SQLITE (for the database / storage / querying as needed)
#
# See README file for more details
